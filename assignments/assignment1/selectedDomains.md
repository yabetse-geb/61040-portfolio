# Assignment 1- Problem Framing

# Selected domains:

# **Domain 1: Self-improvement and accountability**
**Explaination for choice:** Self improvement is on the rise with many ambitious people seeking out ways to improve themselves. On social media many influencers are gaining supporters for their self improvement tips and motivation. However, technology can be used to help users apply self improvement practically and with accountability from other trusted people. I myself, am always trying to find how to improve myself as a student, family member, and person as a whole so this domain greatly interests me.

## **Unselected Problems**:
1. **Procrastination ruining productivity and goal completion**
-  *Problem not selected reasoning*: I am not selecting this problem for a few reasons. The first being procrastination is a very broad problem with many different factors leading to it, for instance lack of interest, anxiety, and stress. So, it is difficult to create a solution for such a wide range of users. Additionally, there is a risk of user abandonment since people who procrastinate are less likely to stick with a task-management app consistently.

2. **Social media addiction**:
- *Problem not selected reasoning*: A solution I wanted to provide was an app that users would report every time they opened social media, and could set limits, and if these limits were reached an accountability partner would be notified. However, due to embarrassment of excessive social media usage, users may be dishonest in their reporting, which is a show stopper. Automatic detection of apps being opened would alleviate this issue, but is not feasible for the scope of this class. Additionally, even with automatic detection users could use other devices to bypass this.

## **Selected problem: Unhealthy sleep schedules**

Problem description: It is very difficult to maintain a healthy and consistent sleep schedule when juggling many responsibilities. College is an environment that often makes it difficult to have adequate sleep schedules as there are many deadlines and extracurricular responsibilities to juggle.
### **Problem selection reasoning**:
- I selected this problem since it is a very wide spread issue especially among my peers as a college student, so there is authentic demand. Since sleep is crucial for health, I believe that many people are eager to find solutions for this problem. Additionally, all people can benefit from a solution to this problem as everyone sleeps which may not be true for social media addiction as older generations are less likely to experience this issue.

### **Stakeholders**

- **Primary user who interacts with app**:
  The user is someone who struggles with keeping good sleep hygiene. They likely are juggling many responsibilities or lack discipline and need assistance in tracking and maintaining a good sleep schedule.

- **Accountability partner**:
  The accountability partner is someone who likely cares for the primary user. They would benefit from the primary user having better sleep hygiene as this is beneficial for their health. Additionally, many people are irritable when sleep deprived so the accountability partner may experience this in their relationship with the primary user.

- **Roommates**:
  Living with others who have poor sleeping habits can be challenging especially when the primary user is awake at very late hours, and therefore unintentionally causing disruptions to roommates' sleep with lights being on and noise being made.


### **Evidence**
**Importance/Scope of Problem:**
- [First Step to Better Sleep: Wake Up at the Same Time Every Day:](https://www.verywellhealth.com/30-days-to-better-sleep-3973920)
  Research shows that keeping a consistent wake-up time is really important for getting good sleep. Irregular sleep schedules can lead to insomnia, poor sleep quality, and trouble falling or staying asleep. This supports the idea that tools to help track and maintain a regular sleep routine could make a real difference.

- [Sleep deprivation in higher education:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation_in_higher_education)
  Among college students, sleep deprivation is notably high, with approximately 70% reporting insufficient sleep and 50% experiencing daytime sleepiness. On average, students obtain only 5.7 hours of sleep per night, often resorting to multiple "all-nighters" each month.

- [Sleep:](https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/sleep)
  Roughly 1 in 3 adults, and even more in adolescents, don’t get sufficient sleep, once again highlighting how widespread this problem is. Insufficient sleep can lead to health problems like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, dementia, and cancer, showing the importance of solving this problem.

- [Impact of Poor Sleep Quality on the Academic Performance of Medical Students](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31192062/)
  A study of medical students of Pakistan found that those with poor sleep quality had an average GPA of 2.92, which was significantly lower than students who got good sleep. This shows how bad sleep habits directly hurt academic performance, and that this is a global issue.

- [Reddit: Looking for sleep accountability partners?:](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/e6jinw/looking_for_a_sleep_accountability_partner_method/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  This reddit user described their idea to look for sleep accountability partners to help with their sleep procrastination. This shows how accountability from others is important for solving this problem, and many current apps related to sleep lack this focus.

- [The buddy boost:](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/27/the-buddy-boost-how-accountability-partners-make-you-healthy-happy-and-more-successful)
  A U.S. study found that simply sharing a goal with someone increases the likelihood of following through to 65%. With consistent check-ins, that likelihood rises to 95%. The gap is that very few sleep apps incorporate this kind of peer accountability to reinforce healthy sleep habits.

- [How Poor Sleep Quality Sabotages Relationships:](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dating-and-mating/202309/is-poor-sleep-quality-sabotaging-your-relationships)
  Studies show that people who don’t sleep well get more irritable and experience more conflict with partners, which can lower overall relationship satisfaction. Fixing sleep habits isn’t just about feeling rested; it can actually help people get along better with the people they care about. This highlights the “ripple effect” of this problem of poor sleep habits.

**Comparables:**
- [Pillow:](https://pillow.app/)
  An app that has very detailed analysis of one’s sleep with helpful diagrams, and the app helps users uncover the “scientifically proven benefits of great sleep”. The limitation of this app is that it doesn’t incorporate the idea of having an accountability partner who can get insights into the primary user’s sleep habits. Passive tracking may cause the user to be less aware of their poor sleeping habits.

- [bettersleep](https://www.bettersleep.com/)
  An app that helps users fall asleep faster with music, meditations, and stories backed by the science of sleep. Helpful for users who find it difficult to sleep at earlier hours. However, a limitation is that it doesn’t really solve the issue of poor sleeping habits as its users are those who are attempting to sleep not avoiding sleep.

- [Sleep Cycle](https://sleepcycle.com/)
  This app, like others, provides great sleep stage tracking; however, it only provides users with information for healthy sleep habits and doesn’t bring in an accountability partner. Once again, passive tracking without much of the user’s input can lead to lack of awareness of one’s poor sleeping habits.




### **Features**
1. **Set bedtime and wake up times:**
- Set a bedtime and get notifications with reminders to wind down if near/exceeded that time. Also, users can set a wake up time, and the user would need to log into the app within five minutes of the wake up time to prove they have woken up. Setting a consistent bedtime and wake up time stabilizes ones’ circadian rhythms which improves the quality of sleep.
2.  **Notify Accountability Partners:**
- If the primary user sleeps past their bed time, email/message the accountability partner the user has requested. Accountability from others greatly helps the primary user stay on track with their sleep schedule when their intrinsic motivation lacks, and their accountability partner will be in the know in terms of the primary user’s progress as a summarized report will be reported to the accountability partner weekly.
3. **Friendly Competition:**
- Every week you can compare “sleep stats” with a partner and see who wins. Stats would include how many days the bed time and wake up time was followed, average number of hours slept per night, etc. This is similar to the accountability partner in adding more extrinsic motivation to help the problem of lacking proper sleep hygiene.









# **Domain 2: Weather-Aware Daily Planning**

**Explanation for choice:** Weather changes a lot in Boston, and it makes daily planning more stressful than it needs to be. There have been many times where I’ve left the house dressed for one kind of weather and ended up completely unprepared later in the day. Current weather apps only give information, but they don’t actually help me make decisions. I’m interested in this domain because it could take something I already check every day and turn it into practical guidance that saves time and reduces stress.

## **Unselected Problems**

1. **Skin and health risks:**
- *Problem not selected reasoning:* Solutions for this problem are somewhat provided as the iOS weather app provides details of an area's UV index and air quality, so there would be insufficient differentiation.

2. **Home energy or utility management:**
- *Problem not selected reasoning:* I believe this problem falls under indifference, where it matters but not enough. I say this because in many areas sudden weather changes are rare, and those who are not paying electricity bills due to factors like being too young or living in a college dorm for instance, would not care about this problem.


## **Selected Problem: Weather-Based Outfit Planning**

**Problem description:** Choosing what to wear each day can be surprisingly stressful and time-consuming, especially when weather conditions are unpredictable. People often spend extra time in the morning deciding what’s appropriate, or risk being uncomfortable if their outfit doesn’t match the weather.

### **Problem selection reasoning**:
- I chose this problem because it represents an authentic, recurring challenge that many people face, especially in places with unpredictable weather like Boston. It’s also a project with clear feasibility: weather APIs are readily available, and the app could dynamically learn user preferences over time. Personally, I’ve experienced the wasted time and stress of second-guessing what to wear, so I see real value in building something that turns raw data into practical guidance. This makes it a strong fit for 6.1040 as it is focused, impactful, and manageable within the scope of the class.

### **Stakeholders**

- **Primary user:** This problem likely causes users to be late for things like work and school, especially for those who are preoccupied with how they present themselves in terms of fashion. Additionally, they may dress inappropriately for the weather especially if the weather is unexpected for the season. For instance in Boston, at times there are sunny days in the winter where the typical attire for winter in Boston isn’t appropriate.

- **User’s boss and teachers:** Users who waste time in the morning being indecisive about their outfits affect their boss’ and teachers who expect them to arrive at certain times.

- **Weather service providers:** Weather service providers likely benefit from the user spending time on their apps/services to ensure their outfits will keep them well dressed for the day.

### **Evidence**
**Importance/Scope of Problem:**

- [Glamour – Time spent choosing outfits](https://www.glamour.com/story/how-much-time-do-you-spend-dec)
  A study found women spend an average of 16 minutes on weekday mornings and 14 minutes on weekend mornings choosing outfits, which adds up to 287 days over a lifetime. This emphasizes how time-intensive choosing outfits in the mornings are.

- [Allure – Time spent by men and women](https://www.allure.com/story/how-much-time-women-spend-picking-clothes)
  Men spend 13 minutes a day, just 4 minutes shy of women. Additionally, according to a poll 62% of women feel "wardrobe rage,” and over a third of men feel the “‘I have nothing to wear and everything’s terrible’” blues. So this is an issue men also go through, and people believe it is a frustrating problem.

- [Glance – Decision fatigue](https://glance.com/blogs/glanceai/fashion/ai-outfit-planner-smart-style?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  We make roughly 35,000 decisions daily and choosing what to wear in the morning is one of the first decisions. Reducing the decisions in clothing will help alleviate this mental overload, known as decision fatigue which can drain your energy, reduce productivity, and confidence. Showing how many areas of one's life this problem can affect.

- [The Guardian – AI styling app](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/19/would-you-let-ai-choose-your-outfits?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  A user shared that using an AI styling app has reduced decision fatigue and helped them rediscover their personal style, despite occasional mismatches in outfit suggestions. This shows that there is demand for even imperfect solutions to what can be a very stressful problem for other people.

- [Reddit – PetPeeves](https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1mvcwjf/people_who_dont_dress_appropriately_for_weather/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  A user on reddit posted in a subreddit called “PetPeeves” commentary on they’re annoyance with people who complain about being either too hot or cold even though they chose to wear inappropriate attire for the weather. This shows how people are indirectly affected by this problem.

- [Reddit – Unpopular opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1hy3l6z/the_vast_majority_of_people_who_hate_the_cold/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  Another user on reddit posted on a subreddit called “unpopularopinion” with a similar annoyance of how people in Canada, where they live, constantly express their hate for the cold while not dressing appropriately for it.

- [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/529881203826371/posts/3143638042450661/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  A facebook post quotes “This weather requires you to move with a sweater, a vest, an umbrella and an ice cream. You just don’t know what will happen next.” This proves how inconsistent weather makes decision making for clothing choices difficult.

**Comparables:**

- [WearToWeather](https://weartoweather.com/)
  WearToWeather is an app that provides AI-powered outfit inspiration for weather, trips, and occasions. However, it is limited in that it doesn’t take into account what clothing the user owns, so the recommendations are not as personalized.

- [WeatherFit](https://weatherfit.com/index.html)
  WeatherFit: An app that uses an animated avatar to suggest outfits according to the weather. A few users complained about the lack of well developed personalization, for instance someone who is pretty accustomed to the cold feels as WearToWeather recommendations would make them too warm.

- [Reddit – AI fashion assistant](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1hf2ylu/would_you_use_this_ai_fashion_assistant_app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  In this link a reddit user offers a solution to this problem that would require the users to upload pictures of their outfits to generate a digital wardrobe. However, a reply highlighted that they would be “too lazy” to upload pictures of all their clothes, and this highlights a difficulty in solving this problem if the solution requires too much input from users to give personalized suggestions for outfits.

### **Features**

1. **Summarized weather report:**
   Uses AI to take data from weather API’s and summarizes the weather report for the day.

2. **Plan outfits for day(s):**
   The user can get suggestions for an outfit for the current day. Additionally, if the user wants to plan outfits ahead for a few days to be proactive or maybe to get help for packing clothes, they can get outfit suggestions for multiple days.

3. **Build digital wardrobe:**
   To get more personalized suggestions users can (optionally) upload pictures of their clothing, building a digital wardrobe. To avoid overwhelming users, the app can ask the user every other day if they would like to upload any clothes so that over time the user can build a digital wardrobe and get more personalized outfits without feeling the need to post pictures of all their clothes before gaining any value from the app.





# **Domain 3: Personal Finance Management**

**Explanation for choice:** Money has always been tricky to manage, and nowadays it’s even easier to spend without realizing it because of automatic subscriptions and one-click purchases. Technology could really help people keep track of where their money is going and avoid those small leaks that add up. I’m interested in this because after my internship I had a good amount of money, but it quickly disappeared before I knew it. I also love trying free trials for delivery apps, ChatGPT, and entertainment services, but I’ve often gotten hit with unwanted charges before I even remembered to cancel. These experiences made me realize how easy it is to lose track of money, and why a tool to help manage it would be really useful.

## **Unselected Problems**

1. **Difficulty keeping track of subscriptions and free trials**
- *Problem not selected reasoning:* I am not selecting this problem because people may just set up reminders on the iOS reminders apps or similar apps that can provide notifications for reminders. Additionally, Google Calendar is a great tool that can notify users of important details for certain dates. Therefore, there is an indifference that may not allow for an authentic need for a new solution to this problem.

2. **Impulsive spending**
- *Problem not selected reasoning:* This problem is hard to pin down because what counts as impulsive spending can vary a lot from person to person. An app trying to flag “impulsive purchases might end up calling normal, intentional purchases impulsive, which could annoy users or make them feel guilty, leading to antibodies.

## **Selected Problem: Money-Owing Disorganization**

**Problem description:** Keeping track of who owes you money and who you owe can be surprisingly tricky, especially when multiple people are involved. It’s easy to forget who has paid and who hasn’t, which can lead to confusion or tension.

### **Problem selection reasoning**
- I chose this problem because keeping track of who owes you money and who you owe is a real, everyday hassle that most apps don’t handle well. Reminders or calendars can tell you when money is due, but they don’t give a shared, clear way for everyone to see what’s been paid and what’s still owed. I’ve run into this myself when I managed payments for a storage unit with 10 people, so I have direct insight into user needs and potential solutions. It’s also feasible because it mostly involves tracking and syncing simple data between users, which is something we can build with existing tools and frameworks. Overall, it feels like a problem that’s serious, doable, and actually useful to solve.

### **Stakeholders**

- **Primary user:** The person managing payments for a group and keeping track of who owes what. The primary user of a solution would be directly impacted by the problem because they need a clear and reliable way to track payments. Without it, they may face confusions, missed payments, or disagreements of payment terms.

- **Secondary users:** People who owe money and need to log their payments. They are impacted by the problem because they need a simple and transparent way to record their payment to reduce misunderstandings. People who owe money often are blamed for not paying back when they in fact have, and this leads to frustrations and lack of trust in relationships.

- **Friends/Family network:** Others connected to the transactions who may be indirectly affected by miscommunication or missed payments. Financial miscommunication can easily create tension or stress in relationships. Even if they aren’t actively entering payments, they may need to clarify what’s owed or mediate disputes, so a solution that improves transparency can prevent awkward social situations and maintain trust within the group.

### **Evidence**

**Importance/Scope of Problem:**

- [ACCC Survey on mobile apps for finance](https://www.consumercredit.com/about-us/news-press-releases/2023/american-consumers-are-turning-to-mobile-apps-in-large-numbers-for-managing-money-and-household-finances-a-new-survey-shows/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  Research from the University of Dar es Salaam looked at how people repay informal loans. It found that clients with multiple informal loans often ended up with higher debt and had a harder time keeping up with repayments, showing just how challenging it can be to manage informal debts.

**Comparables:**

- [Who Owes Me](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=com.blogspot.mravki.whoowesme&utm_source=chatgpt.com&pli=1)
  An app called “Who Owes Me” helps solve this problem by helping organizing the tracking of who owes you money, and even provides the option for different currencies. Some reviewers wished that they could purchase an ad free version, additionally a user pointed out how the “$” symbol is placed after the numeric value which may be confusing for some.

- [Debt Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=com.svprdga.debttracker&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  An app called “Debt Tracker” is similar to “Who Owes Me” in how they address the issue of organizing data for who users owe money to and are owed money from. However, a user complained in a review that they are not able to sort entries of  data for who owes them money from oldest being first to most recent being last. Additionally, they wish they could have more than one debt entry per person instead of needing to create a new contact for the same person if one person owes them money for multiple things.


### **Features**

1. **Shared Payment Ledger:**
   A single, up-to-date record of who owes what and what’s already been paid. Makes it easy to see standings without chasing people down and relying on memory.

2. **Automated Reminders:**
   The app could send gentle reminders when a payment is coming up or overdue, assisting secondary users with reminders and the primary user with automating reminders. This helps people stay on track without constantly checking, and it reduces awkward conversations or confusion about late payments.

3. **Payment Confirmation Tracking:**
   Secondary users can mark payments as complete and attach receipts or notes, adding accountability and clarity for all involved.
